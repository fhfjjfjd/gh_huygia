# Managing GitHub Events — Strict Ruleset

A **strict GitHub event management ruleset** enforcing non-negotiable standards for commits, branches, issues, PRs, releases, changelogs, security, CI/CD, and repository hygiene across all projects.

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive skill ensures consistent, professional GitHub workflows by enforcing:

- ✅ **Conventional Commits v1.0.0** for all commit messages
- ✅ **Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0)** for releases
- ✅ **Keep a Changelog** format for changelogs
- ✅ **Strict branch naming** with type prefixes
- ✅ **Professional PR & issue management**
- ✅ **Security best practices** (SECURITY.md, secret scanning)
- ✅ **CI/CD standards** (pinned actions, permissions, timeouts)
- ✅ **Repository hygiene** (mandatory files, .gitignore, LICENSE, avoiding redundant prefixes)
- ✅ **AI agent compliance** (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Amp, iFlow CLI)

**Violations are REJECTED. No exceptions.** — RFC 2119 compliance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Using This Skill in iFlow CLI

This skill is designed to be used with iFlow CLI for managing GitHub events. To use this skill:

1. Ensure you have iFlow CLI installed and configured
2. Reference this skill when performing GitHub operations
3. Follow the rules defined in this skill for all GitHub events

### 2. Enforce Rules During Development

Use this skill when:
- Creating commit messages (follow Conventional Commits)
- Managing branches (use proper naming)
- Creating pull requests and issues
- Managing releases and changelogs
- Setting up repository hygiene
- Working with AI agents

## 📚 Rules at a Glance

### Commit Messages (Conventional Commits v1.0.0)

**Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

**Allowed types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Examples**:
```
✅ feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow
✅ fix(api): resolve null pointer in user endpoint
✅ feat(api)!: change response format to JSON:API
❌ "fixed stuff"
❌ "feat: Add OAuth2 login flow."  (uppercase + period)
```

**Rules**:
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Max 72 characters on first line
- No uppercase first letter, no period at end
- Breaking changes use `!` after type/scope
- Each commit = one logical change (atomic)
- **FORBIDDEN**: `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git add --all`

→ Full spec: `reference/commit-rules.md`

### Branch Management

**Format**: `<type>/<short-kebab-case-description>`

**Allowed prefixes**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `release/`, `experiment/`

**Examples**:
```
✅ feat/oauth2-login
✅ fix/null-pointer-user-api
✅ hotfix/critical-auth-bypass
❌ feature_oauth    (underscore, wrong prefix)
❌ my-branch        (no type prefix)
```

**Rules**:
- Must use kebab-case
- Max 50 characters
- Delete after merge

→ Full spec: `reference/branch-rules.md`

---

### Pull Requests

**Rules**:
- Title MUST follow Conventional Commits format
- Body MUST include: summary, changes list, related issues, testing, checklist
- Squash merge for feature branches (REQUIRED)
- **MUST NOT merge with failing CI** — NO EXCEPTIONS
- Delete branch after merge
- Self-review after 1-hour cooling period (solo projects)
- MUST reference at least one issue (`Closes #N` or `Relates to #N`)

→ Full spec: `reference/pr-rules.md`

---

### Issues

**Rules**:
- Bug reports MUST include: description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual, environment, logs
- Feature requests MUST include: description, motivation, proposed solution, acceptance criteria
- MUST have ≥1 `type:*` label AND ≥1 `priority:*` label
- Priority: `P0` (critical), `P1` (high), `P2` (medium), `P3` (low)
- **FORBIDDEN**: title-only issues, unlabeled issues

→ Full spec: `reference/issue-rules.md`

---

### Release Management (SemVer 2.0.0)

**Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

**Rules**:
- MAJOR: breaking API changes
- MINOR: backward-compatible new features (resets PATCH to 0)
- PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes only
- Pre-release: `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `1.0.0-beta.2`, `1.0.0-rc.1`
- Tags MUST be annotated: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
- **FORBIDDEN**: deleting/moving tags, non-annotated tags

→ Full spec: `reference/release-rules.md`

---

### Changelog (Keep a Changelog)

**File**: `CHANGELOG.md` in project root (REQUIRED)

**Format**:
- Categories (in order): Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Maintain `[Unreleased]` section at top
- Date format: ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Order: reverse chronological (newest first)
- Include comparison URLs at bottom
- **FORBIDDEN**: git log dumps, auto-generated without curation

→ Full spec: `reference/changelog-rules.md`

---

### Security

**Rules**:
- `SECURITY.md` MUST exist in project root — NO EXCEPTIONS
- Vulnerability reporting via private channel (NOT public issues)
- Response timelines:
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: next release
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for committed secrets, API keys, `.env` files, private keys
- Maintain supported versions table in SECURITY.md

→ Full spec: `reference/security-rules.md`

---

### CI/CD

**Rules**:
- Third-party GitHub Actions MUST be pinned to full commit SHA (NOT tags/branches)
- Workflow files MUST include explicit `permissions` block (least privilege)
- **MUST NOT merge with failing CI** — NO EXCEPTIONS
- Dependencies MUST be cached
- All jobs MUST have timeout set
- Workflow files: `kebab-case.yml` in `.github/workflows/`

**Example**:
```yaml
✅ uses: actions/checkout@a5ac7e51b41094c92402da3b24376905380afc29  # v4.1.6

### Repository Hygiene

**Rules**:
- `.gitignore` MUST exist and cover: OS files, IDE configs, build artifacts, dependencies, `.env`
- `README.md` MUST exist (project name, description, setup, usage, license)
- `LICENSE` file MUST exist in project root
- Project names SHOULD avoid redundant prefixes like 'gh_' when the context is already clear
- **FORBIDDEN**: binary blobs (images >100KB, compiled binaries, archives)
- **FORBIDDEN**: committed `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, build outputs
